#  üçÉMongoDB

## What is MongoDB?

A NoSQL database designed for high performance and scalability
Uses a document-based model instead of tables and rows
Stores data in JSON-like BSON format <br>
üìå **Key Features**
-   Flexible Schema ‚Äì No fixed structure, making it adaptable
-   Scalability ‚Äì Supports horizontal scaling with sharding
-  High Performance ‚Äì Optimized for fast reads and writes
-  Rich Query Language ‚Äì Supports filtering, aggregation, indexing

üìå **MongoDB Atlas ‚Äì Cloud-Based Solution**

- MongoDB Atlas is an online Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS)

- Enables companies to deploy into the cloud quickly and efficiently

üìå**MongoDB in Full-Stack Development**

- Works seamlessly with:

  - Back-end: Open-source frameworks like Node.js & Express.js
  - Front-end: Open-source frameworks like React

- Provides a cost-effective full-stack solution for businesses and students to develop new applications quickly and efficiently

üìå Why Use MongoDB?

Ideal for big data, real-time analytics, and content management
Handles large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data
Popular in modern web apps, IoT, and AI/ML applications

üõ† Use Cases: E-commerce, Social Media, Real-time Analytics



## üÜöNoSQL vs SQL

### üóÉÔ∏è SQL
- A **SQL ** database, like MySQL, is a **relational** database. This means that data is stored in in a structured format, usually called **tables**, containing specific pieces and types of data. Relationships are explicitly made between these tables. That is why you have foreign keys, joins, etc. along with the idea of one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one and many-to-many relationships.
  - A SQL database works best when the data they contain doesn't change very often, and when accuracy is crucial.


###  üìÑNoSQL
- By contrast, a **NoSQL** database is **non-relational**. Data is stored in "unstructured", non-tabular form. For instance, they might be stored in data structures called **documents**. A document can be highly detailed while containing a range of different types of information in different formats. This lets various types of information be organized side-by-side

  - A NoSQL database is often used when large quantities of complex and diverse data need to be organized, and/or when data changes frequently. They are also useful for developing applications where the data needs change quickly.
  - Unstructured data = not arranged according to a pre-set model or schema.
  - In many cases, a NoSQL document is specified in terms of name-value pairs and can be represented using JSON format.

- In NoSQL, each "piece" of data is stored in a single **document**. 
  - This may have multiple fields of information,

  - A document roughly corresponds to a ***row of information in a SQL database***

  - The fields roughly correspond to the columns in a SQL database

- Multiple documents with the same type can be put together in a **collection**
  - This can roughly be thought of as corresponding to a table in MySQL.

- A non-relational database can be massive and can grow exponentially in principle. Since new data in different formats can be added at any time, it is highly flexible to use.

- 80 to 90% of data generated and collected by organizations is unstructured, and its volumes are growing rapidly.

##  ‚öôÔ∏èMongoDB Operations
MongoDb offers a variety of queries that support CRUD operations.  These are similar in capability to MySQL operations, but the details/syntax are quite different.
- [Usage Example](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/usage-examples)
- [Collection](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.13/classes/Collection.html)

### Common operations include:

**Create:**
- collection.insertOne()
- collection.insertMany()

**Read**
- collection.findOne()
- collection.find()

**Update**
- collection.updateOne()
- collection.updateMany()
- collection.replaceOne()

**Update**
- collection.deleteOne()
- collection.deleteMany()

**Additional operations include:**

- collection.findById()
- collection.findByIdAndDelete()
- collection.findByIdAndRemove()
- collection.findByIdAndUpdate()
- collection.findOneAndDelete()
- collection.findOneAndRemove()
- collection.findOneAndReplace()
- collection.findOneAndUpdate()
- collection.countDocuments()

`Sorting` and `Filtering` can be done using [Aggregation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/)

## MongoDB Setup

 Visit [MongoDB's official website](https://www.mongodb.com/) and either set up a local MongoDB server or create a free account on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). In our section, we will setting up the Mongodb on the docker.
